Creativity Optional
local audio client that runs a given command and sends the output to the server

please submit bugs to https://github.com/BCaven/creativity-optional/issues

this is supposed to be a background task started with cron/equivalent
different options/inputs should be handled through an input file or command line arguments
this should not care about server responses (except for server not responding)

Tasks:
[DONE] support for commands passed as command line arguments
[DONE] multiple commands running at different times/refresh rates
[DONE] remove all the audio functions (the base for this was `local_audio_client.py`)
[DONE] support for reading commands from a file
[TODO] multicast server IP detection
[TODO] make sure we are asking to keep the connection alive
[TODO] check if we actually need shlex
[DONE] update try/except statements to only catch the specific error that might happen


Passing in commands:
Reading commands from a file
One command per line
-f [FILENAME]
[KEY] [SLEEP_PERIOD] [COMMAND]

Passing commands as arguments
-c [KEY] [SLEEP_PERIOD] [COMMAND] --close
breaks when an argument is '--close'

Handling different types:
Ideally we would be able to tell the server the type of the incoming data and have it process accordingly.
We can go one of two routes with this:
    Route 1: the server expects integer values between 0 and 100 and throws an error at anything else
        In this route it is the user's job to write a script that converts their output to a int range (0-100)
    
    Route 2: server comes prebuilt with several methods of interpreting values and the user can pick which one to use
        Now it is our job to write conversions for "often used" types (int, str, float, list)
    
    Route 1 is easier and I feel like it will end up being the default anyways when adding custom commands
    Going with route 1 for now
